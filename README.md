# Expense_Tracker_Flask_Backend

A secure, full-authentication Flask backend for a productivity tool that allows users to track personal expenses. Built from scratch to support integration with a pre-built frontend (JWT-based or session-based), this API enables users to manage their own data privately and securely.

  Each authenticated user can manage their own **Expenses**, with full CRUD functionality.

  Users **cannot access or modify other users‚Äô data**.

- **Pagination Support**  
  List endpoints are paginated for better performance and usability.
